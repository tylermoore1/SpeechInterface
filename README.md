# SpeechInterface

We implemented a smart speaker so the user can ask the speaker questions about the volume and/or their songs. They can ask questions about the volume, muting the speaker, connecting a device and playing a song. However, some of these commands are super general because it was hard to store variables. For example, we had a hard time implementing questions such as "What is the volume at" because we couldn't store a variable that had the volume number. Other othan that, our speaker was able to answer basic questions regarding song and volume choice.
